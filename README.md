# What is this?
Somewhat working polyfill for NumberFormat.formatToParts, because Safari.

# How to use?
Just copy-paste the .js in your project.

# How to test?
Open "tests.html" after you cloned the repository and check that it says "All tests passed successfully." in the console.

# Why does this exist?
We needed it for the online store platform we are building at https://shoptico.com/, because our designers like to put different CSS for the $ sign and the actual amounts, but that did not work on Safari.

# Is there an npm, yarn, etc package?
No, sorry, I'm too busy.
